            <h2>Fashion Background</h2>
            <p>Nigo's venture into fashion started in a small store selling a few Bape T-shirts and camouflage print hoodies, which became very popular among teenagers. Nigo then released the Bapesta, a sneaker which, according to Jonathan Ross, became the "epitome of collectable footwear."[3] The Bapesta logo on the side of the shoe resembles the Nike swoosh but has a lightning zap and a star instead. The clothing line is considered by many Americans to be difficult to acquire, considering the fact that the only store in the United States is in New York. (Los Angeles store closed in the summer of 2010.) Along with Pharrell Williams, Nigo is also responsible for helping produce the Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream Footwear brands. He is now the creative director for Uniqlo's UT brand. </p>
